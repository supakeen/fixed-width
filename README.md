# fixed-width

A small easily vendorable (you know that means copy/pastable) library to work
with fixed width types in Python. This library allows you to specify your own
rules for your own fixed width types or to just use a sane default.

You can either work in non-strict mode or strict mode which will raise
exceptions for truncation and promotion.

Different storage types and behaviors are supported.
